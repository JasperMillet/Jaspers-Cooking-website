          <h5 class="w3-center">Everthing You Need To know</h5>
          <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey double">"Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions." -Gordan Ramsy</p>
          <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium double">I ended up discovering my passion very early on in life which was inevitably cooking. It was from this first moment, when I started cooking in the kitchen with my mom, that I aspired to become the best I could be at cooking. I wanted to (and still do) go absolutely tunnel vision on food and cooking only, and I was lucky enough to figure that out very early in life. I hope my recpises encourge you to gain a love for cooking like I have.</p>

          <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium double">I ended up discovering my passion very early on in life which was inevitably cooking. It was from this first moment, when I started cooking in the kitchen with my mom, that I aspired to become the best I could be at cooking.

          <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey double">"Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions." -Gordan Ramsy</p>
          <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium double">I ended up discovering my passion very early on in life which was inevitably cooking. It was from this first moment, when I started cooking in the kitchen with my mom, that I aspired to become the best I could be at cooking. I wanted to (and still do) go absolutely tunnel vision on food and cooking only, and I was lucky enough to figure that out very early in life. I hope my recpises encourge you to gain a love for cooking like I have.</p>

          <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey double">"Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions." -Gordan Ramsy</p>
          <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium double">I ended up discovering my passion very early on in life which was inevitably cooking. It was from this first moment, when I started cooking in the kitchen with my mom, that I aspired to become the best I could be at cooking. I wanted to (and still do) go absolutely tunnel vision on food and cooking only, and I was lucky enough to figure that out very early in life. I hope my recpises encourge you to gain a love for cooking like I have.</p>

          <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey double">"Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions." -Gordan Ramsy</p>
          <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium double">I ended up discovering my passion very early on in life which was inevitably cooking. It was from this first moment, when I started cooking in the kitchen with my mom, that I aspired to become the best I could be at cooking. I wanted to (and still do) go absolutely tunnel vision on food and cooking only, and I was lucky enough to figure that out very early in life. I hope my recpises encourge you to gain a love for cooking like I have.</p>
